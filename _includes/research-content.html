    <h4>• Wireless Nanoscale Optoelectronics for Precision Neural Control</h4>
    <p>
      My research focuses on developing advanced neuromodulation technologies that overcome fundamental limitations in controlling neural activity. While current approaches like deep brain stimulation and pharmacological interventions have made significant contributions to treating neurological disorders, they face challenges in achieving cellular precision, temporal control, and minimally invasive delivery.<br><br>
I've worked on engineering a novel class of microscale wireless electronic devices that can modulate neuronal activity with unprecedented precision. These subcellular-scale platforms (approximately 1/10th the diameter of a human hair) leverage photovoltaic principles to convert light into localized electrical fields that can influence neural membrane potentials.<br><br>
Through careful materials selection and innovative device architecture, I've achieved:<br>
1) Wireless operation that eliminates the need for implanted hardware or batteries<br>
2) Cellular-level precision targeting specific neurons without affecting surrounding tissue<br>
3) Millisecond-scale temporal control enabling precise manipulation of neural activity<br>
4) Bidirectional modulation capability for both increasing and decreasing neural activity<br>
5) Biocompatible interfaces verified through cellular viability testing<br><br>

This technology represents a significant advancement toward minimally invasive neuromodulation with applications ranging from treating epilepsy and chronic pain to enabling fundamental neuroscience research. My approach merges concepts from semiconductor physics, materials science, and neurobiology to create platforms that could transform how we interact with neural circuits.<br>

Note: Detailed specifications and performance metrics are currently confidential pending publication.
