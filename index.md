My name is Preet Patel, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at MIT. I earned my Master's degree (S.M.) from MIT (2022-2024) and completed my undergraduate studies at IIT Kanpur in 2022, double majoring in Electrical and Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My research integrates Engineering, Neuroscience, and Applied Physics, specializing in micro and nanofabrication, nanoelectronics, optical systems, and biomedical applications. I combine these interdisciplinary skills to pioneer advanced bioelectronic technologies with potential applications in neuroscience and medicine. Apart from research, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing sports—particularly badminton and squash—and working out.
