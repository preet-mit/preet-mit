I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Nano‑cybernetic Biotrek group at MIT Media Lab, with an interdisciplinary background in Engineering, Neuro‑science and Applied Physics. My goal is to pioneer novel neurotechnologies that can revolutionize the treatment of neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. My current focus is on developing wireless, injectable optoelectronic devices that use near infra‑red light for precise neural modulation. This work promises to advance bio‑electronic medicine by providing a novel tool for manipulating the nervous system
